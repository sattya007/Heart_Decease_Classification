## Heart_disease_Classification
This project will utilize state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze large amounts of medical data, including lifestyle medical history, and genetic information.

## Problem:
World Health Organization has estimated 12## million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.

## Solution:
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

I have implemented Logistic Regression Model to predict Heart Disease.

### What is Logistic Regression ?
Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

### Data info:
The dataset is available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information.

### Libraries Used -
Pandas (for data manipulation) Matplotlib (for data visualization) Seaborn (for data visualization) Scikit-Learn (for data modeling)
